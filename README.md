# What is this?

This is a game written in Godot, a game engine.

# How do I play this?

This game's not really ready, but if you must, download the Godot Engine from [here](https://godotengine.org/).

From there, you can run `godot project.godot` in this directory, or just use Godot's GUI to edit this project.
